<!-- PROJECT INFO -->
## Project info

This repository houses the exam of _Johan Kresten Horsmans (AU ID: au618771)_ for the course [_Language Analytics_](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/101990/Language-Analytics), as part of the bachelor's elective [_Cultural Data Science_](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University. The repository consists of 4 assignments: three class assignments and one self-assigned project. The following README details how to run the code and contains a thorough explanation of how the repository is structured.

The assignments included in this portfolio are the following:
* Assignment 2 - _String Processing With Python_
* Assignment 3 - _Sentiment Analysis_
* Assignment 5 - _(Un)supervised Machine Learning_
* Assignment 6 - _Text classification using Deep Learning_
* Self-assigned project - _Danish hate speech detection_

<!-- HOW TO RUN -->
## Setting Up Virtual Environment And Downloading Prerequisites

To run the assignments, you need to go through the following steps in your bash-terminal to configure- and activate a virtual environment and download the prerequisites needed to run the code:

__NOTE:__ The code and scripts below will only work for Linux, OS X and Worker02:

```bash
cd {directory where you want the assignment saved}
git clone https://github.com/JohanHorsmans/cds-language-exam-2021.git
cd cds-language-exam-2021
bash create_lang_venv.sh
source lang_venv/bin/activate
```
If you wish to uninstall the virtual environment after running the code, you need to run the following in your bash-terminal:

```bash
cd {cds-language-exam-2021}
bash delete_lang_venv.sh
```

<!-- REPOSITORY STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS -->
## Repository structure and contents

__NOTE:__ Throughout the repository's README-files (including this one), the repository structure is described as it appears before downloading the
additional data specified in the bash-script above.

This repository contains the following folders:

|Folder|Description|
|:--------|:-----------|
```README_images/```| Folder containing the images in the README-files
```assignment_.*/``` | Folders containing code, data and usage-instructions for the four assignments
```self_assigned/``` | Folder containing code, data and usage-instructions for the self-assigned project
```utils/``` | Folder containing functions written by our teacher, [Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ross-deans-kristensenmclachlan(29ad140e-0785-4e07-bdc1-8af12f15856c).html), which are employed in some of the assignments.

Furthermore, it holds the following files:
|File|Description|
|:--------|:-----------|
```create_lang_venv.sh``` | A bash script that generates a new virtual environment called "lang_venv" with all the packages specified in the ```requirements.txt```-file.
```data_download.sh``` | A bash-script that automatically downloads all data and creates the necessary folder structure that is needed to run the assignments.
```requirements.txt``` | A txt-file containing a list of the packages (and versions) that are needed for the virtual environment.
```README.md``` | The README file that you are currently reading.
