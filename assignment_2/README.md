<!-- OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION FROM INSTRUCTOR -->
## Official description from instructor

### String processing with Python

Using a text corpus found on the cds-language GitHub repo __or__ a corpus of your own found on a site such as Kaggle, write a Python script which calculates __collocates__ for a specific keyword.

* The script should take a directory of text files, a keyword, and a window size (number of words) as input parameters, and an output file called out/{filename}.csv
* These parameters can be defined in the script itself
* Find out how often each word collocates with the target across the corpus
* Use this to calculate mutual information between the target word and all collocates across the corpus
* Save result as a single file consisting of three columns: collocate, raw_frequency, MI

* __BONUS CHALLENGE:__ Use argparse to take inputs from the command line as parameters

__General instructions__

* For this assignment, you should upload a standalone .py script which can be executed from the command line.
* Save your script as collocation.py
* Make sure to include a requirements.txt file and your data
* You can either upload the scripts here or push to GitHub and include a link - or both!
* Your code should be clearly documented in a way that allows others to easily follow the structure of your script and to use them from the command line

__Purpose__

This assignment is designed to test that you have a understanding of:

* how to structure, document, and share a Python scripts;
* how to effectively make use of native Python packages for string processing;
* how to extract basic linguistic information from large quantities of text, specifically in relation to a specific target keyword

<!-- METHODS -->
## Methods

The problem in this assignment relates to preprocessing images and then extracting specific features/edges in the image. To solve the task, I started by preprocessing the image with various cv2-functions. To find the edges, I used the _findContours_-function from cv2. As an added bonus, I also used pytesseract to convert the text in the image to a string and print the text in the terminal. To solve the bonus assignment, I used argparse to enable the user to specify arguments from the terminal. With argparse, I made it possible for the user to specify their own image path with an argument called --image_path. In the data-folder in the repository, I included an image titled "Pure_text.png" which the user can use to test the --image_path argument.

<!-- HOW TO RUN -->
## How to run

__NOTICE:__ To run the assignment, you need to have configured and activated your virtual environment. See the main [README](https://github.com/JohanHorsmans/cds-visual-exam-2021/blob/main/README.md) for a guide on how to do this.

Go through the following steps to run assignment 3:
```bash
cd {root directory (i.e. cds-visual-exam-2021}
cd assignment_3
python3 edge_detection.py
```
__You can specify the following optional argument from the terminal:__

_Custom image path:_
```bash
"-i", "--image_path"
default =  os.path.join("data","WHTT.jpg")
type = str
help = string, path to input file. Be weary of difference in operating systems in terms of spcifying path with  "/" or "\".
```
You can also type: ```python3 edge_detection.py -h``` for a detailed guide on how to specify script-arguments. 

<!-- REPOSITORY STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS -->
## Repository structure and contents

This repository contains the following folders:

|Folder|Description|
|:--------|:-----------|
```data/``` | Folder containing data for assignment 3

Furthermore, it holds the following files:
|File|Description|
|:--------|:-----------|
```edge_detection.py``` | The python script for the assignment
```README.md``` | The README file that you are currently reading.

<!-- DATA -->
## Data

The data-folder contains the following files:

|File|Description|
|:--------|:-----------|
WHTT.jpg | An image of a wall with the declaration of independence inscribed. Default image for the script.
Pure_text.png | An image with text saying "Pure Text". Can be used to test the --image_path argument in the script.

<!-- DISCUSSION OF RESULTS -->
## Discussion of results

The contours drawn on the image were quite good (see _figure 1_). Nonetheless, we can see that it has not
succeeded in exclusively capturing the letters since it also has drawn contours on the brick-lines in the wall
where the text is inscribed. When testing the --image_path argument, I experimented with drawing contours on
a lot of different images where it achieved similar levels of performance. As such, I believe that my
solution is quite robust. Furthermore, my script is fairly successful in converting the image to a string as
seen by the following output where there are only a few errors:

_"we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator
with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to securethese
rights governments are instituted among men we solemnly publish and declare that these colonies are and of
right ought to be free and independent states and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on
the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge our lives our fortunes and our sacred honour we"._
